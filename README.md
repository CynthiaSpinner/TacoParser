Project HighLights:
-------------------
-Implemented Test Driven Development by utilizing XUnit for testing methods and Serilog set at minimum level to retrieve information from the console and log in a time stamped file.
-Split substrings of an array then parsed cells to grab longitude, latitude and location name data from csv file. 
-Utilized nested loop techniques to iterate through multiple locationâ€™s latitude and longitude data at the same time.
-Utilized GeoCoordinate class to calculate official coordinates paired with GetDistanceTo to calculate the distance between iterated coordinates.
-Created Method to convert meters to miles for return display.
